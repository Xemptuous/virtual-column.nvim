# Virtual Column

Simple lua plugin that utilizes neovim's virtualtext feature to print a
prettier column markers.

This is my first attempt at writing a neovim plugin, and is still very much a
work in progress. If you have any suggestions/improvements, please please send
them through to me. I'm not an expert on neovim or lua.
